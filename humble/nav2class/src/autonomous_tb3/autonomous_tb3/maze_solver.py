'''
This is a Python script that uses the nav2_simple_commander package to navigate a robot
through a sequence of pre-defined poses in a ROS 2 environment. The BasicNavigator class
is used to control the robot's movement, and the PoseStamped class is used to represent each goal pose.
The setInitialPose() method is used to set the robot's initial position, and goThroughPoses() is used to navigate
the robot through the sequence of goals.
 The script waits for the task to complete before printing the result and shutting down the navigator.
